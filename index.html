<p>Although the E-Class moniker first appeared in 1993 for the W124 generation, Mercedes-Benzs executive car actually can trace its roots all the way back to 1926.


    It was then when the newly formed Mercedes-Benz brand launched the type 8/38 PS (W02), which was named the Stuttgart 200 two years later. The range included the 200 (W21), 230 (W143) and 260 D (W138), launched in 1933, 1936 and 1936 respectively, with the latter being the world's first passenger car powered by a diesel engine.</p>


    <h3>1946-1955: 170V to 170DS</h3>

    <P>After the end of World War II, the company resumed passenger car production in 1946 with the 170 V. The model was actually produced in 1936, but it was upgraded for use by the rescue services, police and tradespeople. One year later, the corresponding saloon was launched as the brands first post-war car, with a 38 HP engine, which was upgraded to 44 HP from 1950.

        Further development led to the expansion of the series. The 170 D diesel came out in 1949, initially with 38 HP and from 1950 with 40 HP. The 170 S Saloon, with a steel body and a 52 HP engine, which was also available as the Cabriolet A and Cabriolet B, joined the range and acted as the top-of-the-line model, until the six-cylinder 220 and 300 were introduced. The 40 HP 170 DS diesel was launched in 1952, and was followed the next year by the 170 S-V and 170 S-D, which remained in production until 1955.</P>

    <h3>1984-1997: The First Mercedes-Benz E-Class Is Officially Born</h3>

    <p>More diverse than ever, this generation was offered in four body styles, namely a sedan, estate, coupe and, for the first time in recent history, a cabriolet, plus a long wheelbase variant and other special models.

        Petrol and diesel engines were available for the 124 model series, starting from 72 to 326 HP in the 500 E that debuted in 1990. The E 60 AMG was launched in 1993 and upped the ante with its 381 HP engine, while features such as the 4Matic four-wheel drive system and multi-link independent rear suspension were introduced.
        
        Falling in line with the smaller C-Class and the bigger S-Class, the 124 was dubbed the E-Class in June 1993, when the modelâ€™s mid-life cycle facelift was launched.
        
        By the time production ended, Mercedes had built 2,737,000 units of the 124 model series, including 2,213,000 sedans, roughly 340,000 estates, 140,000 coupes and 34,000 cabriolets.
