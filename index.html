<p>Although the E-Class moniker first appeared in 1993 for the W124 generation, Mercedes-Benzs executive car actually can trace its roots all the way back to 1926.


    It was then when the newly formed Mercedes-Benz brand launched the type 8/38 PS (W02), which was named the Stuttgart 200 two years later. The range included the 200 (W21), 230 (W143) and 260 D (W138), launched in 1933, 1936 and 1936 respectively, with the latter being the world's first passenger car powered by a diesel engine.</p>
